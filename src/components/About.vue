    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I specialize in building responsive user interfaces, implementing design
      systems and style guides and developing single-page applications using
      Vue.js. I'm also experienced with React, vanilla JavaScript, jQuery,
      Bootstrap, Tailwind, CSS and SCSS.
    </p>

    <p>
      While I've worked with PHP (including Laravel) and WordPress, my real
      passion lies in frontend development â€” I enjoy working with detail and
      bringing designs to life in a clean, pixel-perfect way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the past years, I've contributed to projects across a variety of
      industries, including: real estate, insurance, e-learning, food &
      beverage, literature, plumbing, restaurants and job platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm open to remote opportunities anywhere in Romania or hybrid roles in
      Cluj-Napoca.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to reach out if you're looking for someone who's easy to work
      with, brings a friendly vibe to the team and can help turn beautiful
      designs into smooth user experiences.
